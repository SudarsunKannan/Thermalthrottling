#Thermal throttling for memory bandwidth reduction
# For the exact registers for your platform, please see, Intel software development manual
# and search for  Thermal register values.
# TODO: More generic script for multiple sockets and configurations


Usage
=====

$ sudo ./throttle.sh socket_num throttle_level

e.g., sudo $./throttle.sh 0 2

throttle_level values => 0, 1, 2

In our platform, throttle_level=0 disables throttling, throttle_level=1 reduces bandwidth 
by ~2x-4x, and throttle_level=2 reduces bandwidth by ~8x-10x


socket_num => 0, 1, 2

socket_num = 1 (first socket), socket_num = 0 (second socket), socket_num = 2 ( both sockets)
Currently, this script supports throttling for only two nodes. Will be extended soon...

Note:
=====

For thermal throttling, you should use the  PCI registers using setpci command.
The basic commands go like 

    for i in {4..6}
    do
        setpci -s ff:0$i.3 0x84.L=$throttle
        setpci -s ff:0$i.3 0x48.L=$apply
    done

Registers
========
Next, for the CPU architecture you use, see the Intel software development manual for thermal control registers. They are generally 3 register for each memory socket.
In my machine, the thermal registers are ff:04.3, ff:05.3, ff:06.3.

Values
====== 
$apply - enables or disables the thermal throttling.  For enabling, you can use  hex 2.
apply='0x2'  and for disabling throttling  apply='0x0'

$throttle -  You can throttle speeds using different values.  In my Intel Xeon platform

throttle='0x1f0f'  reduces bandwidth by 2x. throttle='0x0f0f' reduces by 8x. You can try difference hex values by modifying the values.

Note
==== 
Everytime, you modify the values, make sure to run some memory bandwidth benchmark  by binding to a specific  memory node, and see how much bandwidth is reduced. I use the well know stream benchmark. I will notify when I get time to add the script with some notes.

If you end up using the technique, kindly cite our paper :)
